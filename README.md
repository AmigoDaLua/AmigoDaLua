# Hi, I am a front-end developer!

Hello, world! My name is Matheus Pantunes and I am a front-end developer from Brazil. After more than 6 years of working in book designing, I've decided to pursue an old passion: computers!

## My story  ðŸ’¬
In 2022, I've started my studies in Programming, focusing on Web Development. I am passionate about Python/Web and my focus is to learn from the best.

So far, I've concluded **Harvard's CS50** and took certifications on [Flask Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-1512d5cf-228f-43f0-8f21-156731f0783c/) and [SCRUM Fundamentals](https://www.scrumstudy.com/certification/verify?type=SFC&number=960552). I also have [certified english](https://www.efset.org/cert/QQKJU7) and, right now, I am about to finalize **Harvard's CS50P**.

My areas of interest includes: **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **MongoDB** and **SQLite3**. Currently I'm focusing in HTML/CSS/JavaScript because I became a student on the **Oracle Next Education** (ONE) program, which makes me very happy!
