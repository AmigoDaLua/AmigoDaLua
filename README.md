# Hi, I am a Front-End Developer!

Hello, world! My name is Matheus Pantunes and I am a Front-End Developer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. 
## My story  ðŸ’¬
After more than 6 years of working in [book designing](https://agenciadama.com.br/), I've decided to pursue an old passion: computers! 

In 2022, I started **Harvard's CS50** and just after the course I was already focusing on Web Development. I am passionate about the web!

Since, I've been learning from the best. So far, I've concluded:

*  [Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-1512d5cf-228f-43f0-8f21-156731f0783c/) 
*  [SCRUM Fundamentals Certificate](https://www.scrumstudy.com/certification/verify?type=SFC&number=960552)
*  [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://certificates.cs50.io/98184f7d-7b54-4ffd-9e9d-c90699d39cb6.pdf)
*  [Front-End with React.JS (Oracle ONE)](https://cursos.alura.com.br/degree/certificate/1d24c6d8-4e3a-4be4-8c59-2b1915dbe27d)
  
*I   also have  [certified english](https://www.efset.org/cert/QQKJU7)* 

My areas of interest includes: **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React.JS**, **Python** & **Flask**. 

After the conclusion of the *Front-End with React.JS* course, I've discovered a whole new world of possibilities thanks to React, this awesome tool.
So right now I'm studying unit tests with Jest and soon I'll be learning TypeScript. 

I also love videogames, so developing 2D games with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and **LÃ–VE** it's right there in the horizon.
