# Hi, I am a web developer!
Hello, world! My name is **Matheus Antunes** and I am book a designer turning into a web developer.

## My story  ðŸ’¬
After more than 6 years of working my way through words, I've decided to pursue an old passion: computers!

Since natural languages and computer languages are not that different, I'm happy to be currently studying:

* Python
* Flask
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* MongoDB
* SQLite3

I've just finalized **Harvard's CS50** and [Flask Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-developer-bootcamp-flask-python/) 
and now I'm improving my skills by doing [Harvard's CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).
